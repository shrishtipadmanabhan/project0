Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello, my name is Shrishti Padmanabhan and this is my project. It is a website I created using the guidelines provided to me.

 The Main 'Home Page' comes under the file "index.html". As soon as the website is opened, the 'Home' page will be displayed. This page consists of a 'Navigation Bar' that 
 takes the user to different pages on the website. The 'Navigation Bar' is present on all pages of the website, such that it is possible to go from any page to the other via
 hyperlinks. The navigation bar uses CSS selectors such as ":hover" and ":active". This page also contains a "Bootstrap 4" component- the "Popover". The popover is styled
 using a unique "ID'. The styling of the navigation bar and the background color changes when viewed on a mobile device using "@media query".
 
 The 'Academic Acheivements' page consists of two tables- a "html table" and a "Bootsrap 4 grid model" table. The html table is created using CSS selectors such as "element, element"
 and "nth child (n)". The botstrap grid model is used to create an additional table using classes for rows, columns and the container.
 
 The 'Co-Curicular Activities' page contains multiple images and corresponding text designed using divisions. The page uses multiple classes and id's to position images parallel
 to their text.
 
 The 'Extra-Curricular Activities' contains an image and a small writeup designed using classes.
 
 The 'Frequently Asked Questions' page uses a "Ordered List" to anwer basic questions. The font color of the answers and the background color chnages when viewed on a mobile 
 device using "media query".
 
 The 'CSS stylesheet' uses several CSS Properties and Selectors to design different parts of the website. CSS nesting is applied int the various classes of the navigation bar.
 
 In the 'SCSS stylesheet' I have used multiple "SCSS variables" and have applied the concepts of "SCSS nesting" and "SCSS Inheritance".
