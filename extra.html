		<h3 class="extra"> Bharatanatyam is a major form of Indian classical dance that originated thousands of years ago. It is also the oldest classical dance tradition in India. I have been trained by a pioneer in the field, Guru Rhadha, for the past 15 years of my life. Last year I had the amazing oppurtunity to perform of national television! It has been the most wonderful experience and I have been able to perform in multiple states across India!</h3>
